;; Test TypeBuilder
Before setting builder's heap types:
(ref $sig) => (temp ref invalid)
(ref $struct) => (temp ref invalid)
(ref $array) => (temp ref invalid)
(ref null $array) => (temp ref null invalid)

After setting builder's heap types:
(ref $sig) => (temp ref (func (param (temp ref (struct (field (temp ref null (array (mut externref))) (mut (ref extern)))))) (result (temp ref (array (mut externref))))))
(ref $struct) => (temp ref (struct (field (temp ref null (array (mut externref))) (mut (ref extern)))))
(ref $array) => (temp ref (array (mut externref)))
(ref null $array) => (temp ref null (array (mut externref)))

After building types:
(ref $sig) => (ref (func (param (ref (struct (field (ref null (array (mut externref))) (mut (ref extern)))))) (result (ref (array (mut externref))))))
(ref $struct) => (ref (struct (field (ref null (array (mut externref))) (mut (ref extern)))))
(ref $array) => (ref (array (mut externref)))
(ref null $array) => (ref null (array (mut externref)))
