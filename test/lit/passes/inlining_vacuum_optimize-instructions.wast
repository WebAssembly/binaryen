;; Check for a specific bug involving inlining first turning a struct.get's
;; input into a null, then vacuum gets rid of intervening blocks, and then
;; optimize-instructions runs into the following situation: first it turns the
;; struct.get of a null into an unreachable, then it makes a note to itself to
;; refinalize at the end, but before the end it tries to optimize the ref.cast.
;; The ref.cast's type has not been updated to unreachable yet, but its ref has,
;; which is temporarily inconsistent. We must be careful to avoid confusion
;; there.
