;; GUFA manages to generate IR that makes merge-blocks leave a stale type, if we
;; are not careful. simplify-locals-notee then errors if that stale type is
;; present, so all the passes are needed to hit this bizarre corner case.
;;
;; The specific bug that happened here was that merge-blocks operated on
;; dead but not refinalized code. That pass should skip dead code and wait for
;; dce to work first, to avoid generating invalid/stale code.
