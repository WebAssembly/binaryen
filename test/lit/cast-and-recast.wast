;; Test that our hack for br_if output types does not cause the binary to grow
;; linearly with each roundtrip. When we emit a br_if whose output type is not
;; refined enough (Binaryen IR uses the value's type; wasm uses the target's)
;; then we add a cast. We then remove trivial casts like it during load, when we
;; see they are unneeded.

;; RUN: wasm-opt %s -all --roundtrip --roundtrip --roundtrip -S -o - | filecheck %s
