;; Test that we handle multivalue + DWARF correctly. When we need to preserve
;; DWARF info, we don't do any local reordering and all newly added locals
;; during parsing/writing are added at the end of the local list.

;; Generated from this c file with the following command:
;; $ emcc -g -Xclang -target-abi -Xclang experimental-mv dwarf-multivalue.c -o dwarf-multivalue.wasm
;;
;; struct MyStruct {
;;   int a;
;;   float b;
;; };
;;
;; struct MyStruct foo() {
;;   struct MyStruct ret = {.a = 3, .b = 3.5};
;;   return ret;
;; }
;;
;; void test() {
;;   struct MyStruct s = foo();
;; }
;;
;; int main() {
;;   test();
;;   return 0;
;; }

;; The original wasm file's $test function's locals are as follows:
;; (func $test
;;  (local $0 i32)
;;  (local $1 i32)
;;  (local $2 i32)
;;  (local $3 i32)
;;  (local $4 f32)
;;  (local $5 i32)
;;  (local $6 i32)
;;  (local $7 i32)
;;  (local $8 f32)
;;  (local $9 i32)
;;  (local $10 f32)

;; If we parse this wasm file into Binaryen IR, two locals are added in the
;; process. Here $scratch is added for tuple parsing and $scratch_12 is added
;; for stacky IR resolving during binary reading process.
;; RUN: wasm-dis %s.wasm -o - | filecheck %s --check-prefix=ORIG
;; ORIG:      (func $test
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $0 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $1 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $2 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $3 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $4 f32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $5 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $6 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $7 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $8 f32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $9 i32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $10 f32)
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $scratch (tuple i32 f32))
;; ORIG-NEXT:  (local $scratch_12 i32)

;; If we write this IR into binary, even if this cannot be displayed in the wast
;; format, the local order of $test will look like this, because we don't
;; reorder locals:
;; (func $test
;;  (local $0 i32)
;;  (local $1 i32)
;;  (local $2 i32)
;;  (local $3 i32)
;;  (local $4 f32)
;;  (local $5 i32)
;;  (local $6 i32)
;;  (local $7 i32)
;;  (local $8 f32)
;;  (local $9 i32)
;;  (local $10 f32)
;;  (local $11 i32) ;; Previous (local $11 (tuple i32 f32))'s first element
;;  (local $12 f32) ;; Previous (local $11 (tuple i32 f32))'s second element
;;  (local $13 i32) ;; Previous (local $12 i32)

;; We parse this binary again into Binaryen IR, roundtripping the original
;; binary. Locals $14 and $15 are added for stacky IR resolving during binary
;; reading process.
;; RUN: wasm-opt -all -g --roundtrip %s.wasm -S -o - | filecheck %s --check-prefix=ROUNDTRIP
;; ROUNDTRIP:      (func $test
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $0 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $1 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $2 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $3 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $4 f32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $5 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $6 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $7 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $8 f32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $9 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $10 f32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $scratch i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $12 f32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $scratch_12 i32)
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $scratch_14 (tuple i32 f32))
;; ROUNDTRIP-NEXT:  (local $scratch_15 i32)

;; We can see that we don't reorder the locals during the process and the
;; original list of locals, local $0~$10, is untouched, to NOT invalidate DWARF
;; info.
