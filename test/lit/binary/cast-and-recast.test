# Verify that we emit extra casts for br_if values that are more refined than
# in wasm.
#
# `cast-and-recast.wasm` was generated from cast-and-recast.wast, which
# contains two cases that need such casts and one that does not, and the binary
# was manually inspected to see that it contains exactly the right two casts.
