;; Test that we emit deduplicated names even in the corner case that one item
;; is in the names section and the other is not, and the latter's temp name
;; coincides with the name the name section gives for the first. Specifically,
;; the input wasm looks like this:
;;
;;  (module
;;   (global $global$1 i32 (i32.const 1)) ;; In names section.
;;   (global $........ i32 (i32.const 0)) ;; *Not* in names section.
;;  )
;;
;; We give them temp names $global$0, $global$1 to begin with, then apply the
;; names section which turns the first's name into $global$1 - identical to the
;; second. We must then deduplicate the second name to avoid a collision. (Note
;; that we leave the name from the names section as it is, and only adjust the
;; temp name.)


;; CHECK:      (global $global$1 i32 (i32.const 1))

;; CHECK:      (global $global$1_1 i32 (i32.const 0))
