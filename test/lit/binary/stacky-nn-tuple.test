# Verify stacky non-nullable tuples binary can be parsed correctly. The wasm
# contains code that uses pops to get a tuple and store it in a local, then
# reads those values. The file contains this:
#
# (module
#  (type $A (struct (field (mut i32))))
#  (type $B (struct (field (mut i32)) (field (mut i32))))
#  (tag $tag$0 (param (ref $A) (ref $B)))
#  (func $foo
#   (local $temp ((ref null $A) (ref null $B)))
#   (try $label$3
#    (do
#     (nop)
#    )
#    (catch $tag$0
#     (local.set $temp
#      (pop (ref $A) (ref $B))
#     )
#     (drop
#      (ref.as_non_null
#       (tuple.extract 0
#        (local.get $temp)
#       )
#      )
#     )
