"binaryen.ts" file is the single source of truth for exposing binaryen's JS API.
The committed file imports the js file generated by emscripten as follows:
```Typescript
const JSModule = await import("./binaryen_raw_TARGET.js");
```
That file exists in the source code, but it's only here to help compile binaryen.ts during development.
(this is done using `tsc --target ES2020 --module ES2022 --declaration --declarationMap binaryen.ts`)
During build, the file name is replaces by the real one using sed, as follows:
```
sed -e 's/TARGET/<suffix>/g' binaryen_ts.ts
```
where `<suffix>` is either "js" or "wasm", depending on the target.

"binaryen_post.ts" contains the minimal constructs to inject in the generated js file, required by binaryen.ts. 
During build, the file is compiled to js (using tsc) and then injected using emscripten's --post-js option.
