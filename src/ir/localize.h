// Replaces all children with gets of locals, if they have any effects that
// interact with any of the others, or if they have side effects which cannot be
// removed. Also replace unreachable things with an unreachable, leaving in
// place only things without interacting effects. For example:
//
//  (parent
//    (call $foo)
//    (br $out)
//    (i32.const)
//  )
//
// =>
//
//  (local.set $temp.foo
//    (call $foo)            ;; moved out
//  )
//  (br $out)                ;; moved out
//  (parent
//    (local.get $temp.foo)  ;; value saved to a local
//    (unreachable)          ;; complex effect replaced by unreachable
//    (i32.const)
//  )
//
// After this it is safe to reorder and remove things from the parent: all
// interesting interactions happen before the parent.
//
// Typical usage is to call getReplacement() will produces the entire output
// just shown (i.e., possible initial local.sets and other stuff that was pulled
// out, followed by the parent, as relevant). Note that getReplacement() may
// omit the parent, if it had an unreachable child. That is useful behavior in
// that it removes unneeded code (& otherwise some users of this code would need
// to write their own removal logic). However, that does imply that it is valid
// to remove the parent in such cases, which is not so for e.g. br when it is
// the last thing keeping a block reachable. Calling this with something like a
// struct.new or a call (the current intended users) is valid; if we want to
// generalize this fully then we need to make changes here.
