  // interfere say with replacing f(y) with f(x + 20). Instead, if we know the
  // only other possible set for x is the zero init, then things like the !!!
  // line cannot exist, and it is valid to replace f(y) with f(x + 20). (This
  // could be simpler, but in wasm the zero init always exists.)
