// module-splitting.h: Provides an interface for decomposing WebAssembly modules
// into multiple modules that can be loaded independently. This works by moving
// functions to a new secondary module and rewriting the primary module to call
// them indirectly. Until the secondary module is instantiated, those indirect
// calls will go to placeholder functions newly imported into the primary
// module. If the primary module has a single segment with a non-constant
// offset, the placeholder function import names are the offsets from that base
// global of the corresponding functions in the table. Otherwise, the
// placeholder import names are the absolute table indices of the corresponding
// functions. The secondary module imports all of its dependencies from the
// primary module.
//
// This code currently makes a couple assumptions about the modules that will be
// split and will fail assertions if those assumptions are not true.
//
//   1) It assumes that mutable-globals are allowed.
//
//   2) It assumes that either all segment offsets are constants or there is
//      exactly one segment that may have a non-constant offset.
//
// These requirements will be relaxed as necessary in the future, but for now
// this code should be considered experimental and used with care.
