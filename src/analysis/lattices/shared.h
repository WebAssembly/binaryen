// the current value of that single element of L, which is generally safe
// because the current value always overapproximates (i.e. is higher in the
// lattice than) the value at the time of the Shared element's construction.

// Each element of this lattice maintains a sequence number that corresponds to
// a value the shared underlying element has had at some point in time. Higher
// sequence numbers correspond to greater values of the underlying element.
// Elements of this lattice are compared and joined using these sequence
// numbers, so blocks will correctly be re-analyzed if the value has increased
