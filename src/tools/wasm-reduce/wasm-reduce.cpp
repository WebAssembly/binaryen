  ToolOptions options(
    "wasm-reduce",
    R"(Reduce a wasm file to a smaller one with the same behavior on a given command.

Typical usage:

  wasm-reduce orig.wasm '--command=bash a.sh' --test t.wasm --working w.wasm

The original file orig.wasm is where we begin. We then repeatedly test a small
reduction of it by writing that modification to the 'test file' (specified by
'--test'), and we run the command, in this example 'bash a.sh'. That command
should use the test file (and not the original file or any other one). Whenever
the reduction works, we write that new smaller file to the 'working file'
(specified by '--working'). The reduction 'works' if it correctly preserves the
behavior of the command on the original input, specifically, that it has the
same stdout and the result return code. Each time reduction works we continue to
reduce from that point (and each time it fails, we go back and try something
else).

As mentioned above, the command should run on the test file. That is, the first
thing that wasm-reduce does on the example above is, effectively,

  cp orig.wasm t.wasm
  bash a.sh

In other words, it copies the original to the test file, and runs the command.
Whatever the command does, we will preserve as we copy progressively smaller
files to t.wasm. As we make progress, the smallest file will be written to
the working file, w.wasm, and when reduction is done you will find the final
result there.

Comparison to creduce:

1. creduce requires the command to return 0. wasm-reduce is often used to reduce
   crashes, which have non-zero return codes, so it is natural to allow any
   return code. As mentioned above, we preserve the return code as we reduce.
2. creduce ignores stdout. wasm-reduce preserves stdout as it reduces, as part
   of the principle of preserving the original behavior of the command (if your
   stdout varies in uninteresting ways, your command can be a script that runs
   the real command and captures stdout to /dev/null, or filters it).
3. creduce tramples the original input file as it reduces. wasm-reduce never
   modifies the input (to avoid mistakes that cause data loss). Instead,
   when reductions work we write to the 'working file' as mentioned above, and
   the final reduction will be there.
4. creduce runs the command in a temp directory. That is safer in general, but
   it is not how the original command ran, and in particular forces additional
   work if you have multiple files (which, for wasm-reduce, is common, e.g. if
   the testcase is a combination of JavaScript and wasm). wasm-reduce runs the
   command in the current directory (of course, your command can be a script
   that changes directory to anywhere else).
