//
// Local CSE
//
// This finds common sub-expressions and saves them to a local to avoid
// recomputing them. It runs in each basic block separately, and uses a simple
// algorithm, where we track "requests" to reuse a value. That is, if we see
// an add operation appear twice, and the inputs must be identical in both
// cases, then the second one requests to reuse the computed value from the
// first. The first one to appear is the "original" expression that will remain
// in the code; we will save it's value to a local, and get it from that local
// later:
//
//  (i32.add (A) (B))
//  (i32.add (A) (B))
//
//    =>
//
//  (local.tee $temp (i32.add (A) (B)))
//  (local.get $temp)
//
// The algorithm used here is as follows:
//
//  * Scan: Hash each expression and see if it repeats later.
//          If it does:
//            * Note that the original appearance is requested to be reused
//              an additional time.
//            * Link the first expression as the original appearance of the
//              later one.
//            * Scan the children of the repeat and undo their requests to be
//              replaced (as if we will reuse the parent, we don't need to do
//              anything for the children, see below).
//
//  * Check: Check if effects prevent some of the requests from being done. For
//           example, if the value contains a load from memory, we cannot
//           optimize around a store, as the value before the store might be
//           different (see below).
//
//  * Apply: Go through the basic block again, this time adding a tee on an
//           expression whose value we want to use later, and replacing the
//           uses with gets.
//
// For example, here is what the algorithm would do on
//
//  (i32.eqz (A))
//  ..
//  (i32.eqz (A))
//
// Assuming A does not have side effects that interfere, this will happen:
//
//  1. Scan A and add it to the hash map of things we have seen.
//  2. Scan the eqz, and do the same for it.
//  3. Scan the second A. Increment the first A's requests counter, and mark the
//     second A as intended to be replaced by the original A.
//  4. Scan the second eqz, and do similar things for it: increment the requests
//     for the original eqz, and point to the original from the repeat.
//     * Then also scan its children, in this case A, and decrement the first
//       A's reuse counter, and unmark the second A's note that it is intended
//       to be replaced.
//  5. After that, the second eqz requests to be replaced by the first, and
//     there is no request on A.
//  6. Run through the block again, adding a tee and replacing the second eqz,
//     resulting in:
//
//   (local.tee $temp
//     (i32.eqz
//       (A)
//     )
//   )
//   (local.get $temp)
//
// Note how the scanning of children avoids us adding a local for A: when we
// reuse the parent, we don't need to also try to reuse the child.
//
// Effects must be considered carefully by the Checker phase. E.g.:
//
//  x = load(a);
//  store(..)
//  y = load(a);
//
// Even though the load looks identical, the store means we may load a
// different value, so we will invalidate the request to optimize here.
//
// This pass only finds entire expression trees, and not parts of them, so we
// will not optimize this:
//
//  (A (B (C (D1))))
//  (A (B (C (D2))))
//
// The innermost child is different, so the trees are not identical. However,
// running flatten before running this pass would allow those to be optimized as
// well (we would also need to simplify locals somewhat to allow the locals to
// be identified as identical, see pass.cpp).
//
// TODO: Global, inter-block gvn etc. However, note that atm the cost of our
//       adding new locals here is low because their lifetimes are all within a
//       single basic block. A global optimization here could add long-lived
//       locals with register allocation costs in the entire function.
