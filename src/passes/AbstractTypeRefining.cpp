    // potential (perhaps different values are written to each, and GUFA or
    // another pass can optimize each separately, but not if they were merged).
    // However, the type rewriter will create a single new rec group for all new
    // types anyhow, so they all remain distinct from each other. The only thing
    // that would actually merge them is if we run TypeMerging, which is not run
    // by default exactly for this reason, that it can limit optimizations.
    // Thus, this pass does only "safe" merging, that cannot limit later
