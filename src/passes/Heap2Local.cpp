//
// Find heap allocations that never escape the current function, and lower the
// allocation's data into locals. That is, avoid allocating a GC object, and
// instead use one local for each of its fields.
//
// To get a sense for what this pass does, here is an example to clarify. First,
// in pseudocode:
//
//   ref = new Int(42)
//   do {
//     ref.set(ref.get() + 1)
//   } while (import(ref.get())
//
// That is, we allocate an int on the heap and use it as a counter.
// Unnecessarily, as it could be a normal int on the stack.
//
// Wat:
//
//   (module
//    ;; A boxed integer: an entire struct just to hold an int.
//    (type $boxed-int (struct (field (mut i32))))
//
//    (import "env" "import" (func $import (param i32) (result i32)))
//
//    (func $example
//     (local $ref (ref null $boxed-int))
//
//     ;; Allocate a boxed integer of 42 and save the reference to it.
//     (local.set $ref
//      (struct.new $boxed-int
//       (i32.const 42)
//      )
//     )
//
//     ;; Increment the integer in a loop, looking for some condition.
//     (loop $loop
//      (struct.set $boxed-int 0
//       (local.get $ref)
//       (i32.add
//        (struct.get $boxed-int 0
//         (local.get $ref)
//        )
//        (i32.const 1)
//       )
//      )
//      (br_if $loop
//       (call $import
//        (struct.get $boxed-int 0
//         (local.get $ref)
//        )
//       )
//      )
//     )
//    )
//   )
//
// Before this pass, the optimizer could do essentially nothing with this. Even
// with this pass, running -O1 has no effect, as the pass is only used in -O2+.
// However, running --heap2local -O1 leads to this:
//
//    (func $0
//     (local $0 i32)
//     (local.set $0
//      (i32.const 42)
//     )
//     (loop $loop
//      (br_if $loop
//       (call $import
//        (local.tee $0
//         (i32.add
//          (local.get $0)
//          (i32.const 1)
//         )
//        )
//       )
//      )
//     )
//    )
//
// All the GC heap operations have been removed, and we just have a plain int
// now, allowing a bunch of other opts to run.
//
// For us to replace an allocation with locals, we need to prove two things:
//
//  * It must not escape from the function. If it escapes, we must pass out a
//    reference anyhow. (In theory we could do a whole-program transformation
//    to replace the reference with parameters in some cases, but inlining can
//    hopefully let us optimize most cases.)
//  * It must be used "exclusively", without overlap. That is, we cannot
//    handle the case where a local.get might return our allocation, but might
//    also get some other value. We also cannot handle a select where one arm
//    is our allocation and another is something else. If the use is exclusive
//    then we have a simple guarantee of being able to replace the heap
//    allocation with the locals.
//
// Non-exclusive uses are optimizable too, but they require more work and add
// overhead. For example, here is a non-exclusive use:
//
//   var x;
//   if (..) {
//     x = new Something(); // the allocation we want to optimize
//   } else {
//     x = something_else;
//   }
//   // 'x' here is not used exclusively by our allocation
//   return x.field0;
//
// To optimize x.field0, we'd need to check if it contains our allocation or
// not, perhaps marking a boolean as true when it is, then doing an if on that
// local, etc.:
//
//   var x_is_our_alloc; // whether x is our allocation
//   var x; // keep x around for when it is not our allocation
//   var x_field0; // the value of field0 on x, when x is our allocation
//   if (..) {
//     x_field0 = ..default value for the type..
//     x_is_our_alloc = true;
//   } else {
//     x = something_else;
//     x_is_our_alloc = false;
//   }
//   return x_is_our_alloc ? x_field0 : x.field0;
//
// (node splitting/code duplication is another possible approach). On the other
// hand, if the allocation is used exclusively in all places (the if-else above
// does not have an else any more) then we can do this:
//
//   var x_field0; // the value of field0 on x
//   if (..) {
//     x_field0 = ..default value for the type..
//   }
//   return x_field0;
//
// This optimization focuses on such cases.
