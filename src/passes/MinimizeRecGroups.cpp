// Split types into minimal recursion groups by computing the strongly connected
// components of the type graph, which are the minimal sets of
// mutually-recursive types that must be in the same recursion group with each
// other for the type section to validate.
//
// We must additionally ensure that distinct types remain distinct, which would
// not be the case if we allowed two separate strongly connected components with
// the same shape to be rewritten to two copies of the same recursion group.
// Accidentally merging types would be incorrect because it would change the
// behavior of casts that would have previously been able to differentiate the
// types.
//
// When multiple strongly connected components have the same shape, first try to
// differentiate them by permuting their types, which keeps the sizes of the rec
// groups as small as possible. When there are more strongly connected
// components that are permutations of one another than there are distinct
// permutations, fall back to keeping the types distinct by adding distinct
// brand types to the recursion groups to ensure they have different shapes.
//
// There are several possible algorithmic design for detecting when to generate
// permutations and determining what permutations to generate. They trade off
// the amount of "wasted" work spent generating shapes that have already been
// used with the amount of work spent trying to avoid the wasted work and with
// the quality of the output.
//
// The simplest possible design that avoids all "wasted" work would be to
// canonicalize the shape of each group to eagerly detect isomorphisms and
// eagerly organize the groups into equivalence classes. This would allow us to
// avoid ever generating permutations of a group with shapes that have already
// been used. See `getCanonicalPermutation` below for details on how this works.
// However, this is not an ideal solution because canonicalization is an
// expensive operation and in the common case a group's shape will not conflict
// with any other group's shape, so canonicalization itself would be wasted
// work.
//
// The simplest possible design in the other direction is to never canonicalize
// and instead to lazily build up equivalences classes of isomorphic groups when
// shape conflicts are detected in practice. Conflicts are resolved by choosing
// the next permutation generated by the representative element of the
// equivalence class. This solution is not ideal because groups with high
// symmetry can have very many permutations that have the same shape, so many
// permutations might need to be generated before finding one that is distinct
// from previous permutations with respect to its shape. This work can be
// sidestepped by instead eagerly advancing the brand type, but that increases
// the code size of the output.
//
// The design chosen here is a hybrid of those two designs that is slightly more
// complicated, but gets the best of both worlds. We lazily detect equivalence
// classes of groups without eager shape canonicalization like in the second
// design, but we canonicalize the shape for any equivalence class that grows
// larger than one group like in the first design. This ensures that we don't
// spend time canonicalizing in the common case where there are no shape
// conflicts, but it also ensures that we don't waste time generating
// permutations with shapes that conflict with the shapes of previous groups. It
// also allows us to avoid compromising on the quality of the output.

    //     (rec
    //       (type $a2 (struct (field (ref $a1) (ref $b2))))

    //       (type $b1 (struct (field (ref $b2) (ref $a1))))
    //     )
    //
    // We can verify that the permutation was an automorphism by checking that
    // the label-independent properties of these two rec groups are the same.
    // Indeed, when we write the adjacency matrices with ordered edges for the

    //     2: 1 _ _ 0

    //
    // In addition to having the same adjacency matrix, the two recursion groups
    // have the same vertex colorings since all of their types have the same
    // top-level structure. Since the label-independent properties of the
    // recursion groups (i.e. all the properties except the intended type
    // identity at each index) are the same, the permutation that takes one
    // group to the other is an automorphism. These are precisely the
    // permutations that do not change a recursion group's shape, so would not
    // change type identity under WebAssembly's isorecursive type system. In
    // other words, automorphisms cannot help us resolve shape conflicts, so we
    // want to avoid generating them.
    //
    // Theorem 1: All cycles in an automorphism of a strongly-connected
    // recursion group are the same size.
    //
    //     Proof: By contradiction. Assume there are two cycles of different
    //     sizes. Because the group is strongly connected, there is a path from
    //     an element in the smaller of these cycles to an element in the
    //     larger. This path must contain an edge between two vertices in cycles
    //     of different sizes N and M such that N < M. Apply the automorphism N
    //     times. The source of this edge has been cycled back to its original
    //     index, but the destination is not yet back at its original index, so
    //     the edge's destination index is different from its original
    //     destination index and the permutation we applied was not an
    //     automorphism after all.
    //
    // Corollary 1.1: No nontrivial automorphism of an SCC may have a stationary
    // element, since either all the cycles have size 1 and the automorphism is
    // trivial or all the cycles have some other size and there are no
    // stationary elements.
    //
    // Corollary 1.2: No two distinct permutations of an SCC with the same first
    // element (e.g. both with some type $t as the first element) have the same
    // shape, since no nontrivial automorphism can keep the first element
    // stationary while mapping one permutation to the other.

    // in the group. Since the group is strongly connected, a tree search from
    // any of types will visit all types in the group, so it will generate a
    // total and deterministic ordering of the types in the group. We can
    // compare the shapes of each of these orderings to organize the root
    // types and their generated orderings into ordered equivalence classes.
    // These equivalence classes each correspond to a cycle in an automorphism
    // of the graph because their elements are vertices that can all occupy the
    // initial index of the graph without the graph structure changing. We can
    // choose an arbitrary ordering from the least equivalence class as a
    // canonical ordering because all orderings in that class describe the same
    // label-independent graph.
