// Sorts globals by their static use count. This helps reduce the size of wasm
// binaries because fewer bytes are needed to encode references to frequently
// used globals.
//
// This pass also sorts by dependencies, as each global can only appear after
// those it refers to. Other passes can use this internally to fix the ordering
// after they add new globals.
//
// The "always" variant of this pass will always sort globals, even if there are
// so few they all fit in a single LEB. In "always" mode we sort regardless and
// we measure size by considering each subsequent index to have a higher cost.
// That is, in reality the size of all globals up to 128 is a single byte, and
// then the LEB grows to 2, while in "always" mode we increase the size by 1/128
// for each global in a smooth manner. "Always" is mainly useful for testing.
