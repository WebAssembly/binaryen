v73
---

v55
---

- `RelooperCreate` in the C API now has a Module parameter, and

- Relooper: Condition properties on Branches must not have side effects.

older
-----

- `BinaryenSetFunctionTable` in the C API no longer accepts an array of
  functions, instead it accepts an array of function names, `const char**
  funcNames`. Previously, you could not include imported functions because they
  are of type `BinaryenImportRef` instead of `BinaryenFunctionRef`. #1650

- `BinaryenSetFunctionTable` in the C API now expects the initial and maximum
  table size as additional parameters, like `BinaryenSetMemory` does for pages,
  so tables can be grown dynamically. #1687

- Add `shared` parameters to `BinaryenAddMemoryImport` and `BinaryenSetMemory`,
  to support a shared memory. #1686
