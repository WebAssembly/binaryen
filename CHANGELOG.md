Not all changes are documented here. In particular, new features, user-oriented
fixes, options, command-line parameters, usage changes, deprecations,
significant internal modifications and optimizations etc. generally deserve a
mention. To examine the full set of changes between versions, visit the link to
full changeset diff at the end of each section.

Current Trunk
-------------

- The C-API's `BinaryenSetAPITracing` and the JS-API's `setAPITracing` have been
  removed because this feature was not very useful anymore and had a significant
  maintainance cost.
- wasm-emscripten-finalize will no longer generate `stackSave`, `stackAlloc`,
  `stackRestore` function.  It not expects them to be included in the input
  file.

v93
---

- First release with binaries built with github actions.


v92
---

- The `multivalue` feature has been added. It allows functions and control flow
  structures to return tuples and for locals and globals to have tuple types.
  Tuples are created with the new `tuple.make` pseudoinstruction and their
  elements are retrieved with the new `tuple.extract` pseudoinstruction.
- The internal type interner has been rewritten to avoid taking locks in far
  more situations. Depending on the workload, this may result in large speedups
  and increased parallelism.
- Represent the `dylink` section in Binaryen IR, so we can read, write, and
  update it.

v91
---

- `BinaryenExpressionGetSideEffects` (C API) and `getSideEffects` (JS API) now
  takes an additional `features` parameter.
- Reference type support is added. Supported instructions are `ref.null`,
  `ref.is_null`, `ref.func`, and typed `select`. Table instructions are not
  supported yet. For typed `select`, C/JS API can take an additional 'type'
  parameter.

v90
---

- `local.tee`'s C/Binaryen.js API now takes an additional type parameter for its
  local type, like `local.get`. This is required to handle subtypes.
- Added load_splat SIMD instructions
- Binaryen.js instruction API changes:
  - `notify` -> `atomic.notify`
  - `i32.wait` / `i64.wait` -> `i32.atomic.wait` / `i64.atomic.wait`
- Binaryen.js: `flags` argument in `setMemory` function is removed.
- `atomic.fence` instruction support is added.
- wasm-emscripten-finalize: Don't rely on name section being present in the
  input. Use the exported names for things instead.
- Added `mutable` parameter to BinaryenAddGlobalImport.
- Replace BinaryenSIMDBitselect* with BinaryenSIMDTernary* in the C API and add
  qfma/qfms instructions.
- Added `offset` parameter to BinaryenSetFunctionTable.
- Add the ability to create multivalue Types in the C and JS APIs.
- Remove named function types. They are replaced by `params` and `results` types
  local to each function.
- Binaryen.js can now be compiled to Wasm using the `binaryen_wasm` target.
  Unlike the JS variant, the Wasm variant requires asynchronously awaiting the
  Wasm blob's instantiation and initialization before being usable, using the
  `binaryen.ready` promise, e.g. `binaryen.ready.then(() => ...)`.
- Binaryen.js now uses `binaryen` (was `Binaryen`) as its global name to align
  with the npm package.
- Binaryen.js: The result of `getMemorySegmentInfoByIndex` now has the same
  structure as the respective inputs on creation (`byteOffset` -> `offset`).

v88
---

- wasm-emscripten-finalize: For -pie binaries that import a mutable stack
  pointer we internalize this an import it as immutable.
- The `tail-call` feature including the `return_call` and `return_call_indirect`
  instructions is ready to use.

v87
---

- Rename Bysyncify => Asyncify

v86
---

- The --initial-stack-pointer argument to wasm-emscripten-finalize no longer
  has any effect.  It will be removed completely in future release.

v85
---

- Wast file parsing rules now don't allow a few invalid formats for typeuses
  that were previously allowed. Typeuse entries should follow this format,
  meaning they should have (type) -> (param) -> (result) order if more than one
  of them exist.
  ```
  typeuse ::= (type index|name)+ |
              (type index|name)+ (param ..)* (result ..)* |
              (param ..)* (result ..)*
  ```
  Also, all (local) nodes in function definition should be after all typeuse
  elements.
- Removed APIs related to deprecated instruction names in Binaryen.js:
  - `get_local` / `getLocal`
  - `set_local` / `setLocal`
  - `tee_local` / `teeLocal`
  - `get_global` / `getGlobal`
  - `set_global` / `setGlobal`
  - `current_memory` / `currentMemory`
  - `grow_memory` / `growMemory`
  They are now available as their new instruction names:
  `local.get`, `local.set`, `local.tee`, `global.get`, `global.set`,
  `memory.size`, and `memory.grow`.
- Add feature handling to the C/JS API with no feature enabled by default.

v84
---

- Generate dynCall thunks for any signatures used in "invoke" calls.

v81
---

- Fix AsmConstWalker handling of string address in arg0 with -fPIC code

v80
---

- Change default feature set in the absence of a target features section from
  all features to MVP.

v79
---

- Improve support for side modules

v78
---

- Add `namedGlobals` to metadata output of wasm-emscripten-finalize
- Add support for llvm PIC code.
- Add --side-module option to wasm-emscripten-finalize.
- Add `segmentPassive` argument to `BinaryenSetMemory` for marking segments
  passive.
- Make `-o -` print to stdout instead of a file named "-".

v73
---

- Remove wasm-merge tool.

v73
---

- Remove jsCall generation from wasm-emscripten-finalize.  This is not needed
  as of https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/8255.

v55
---

- `RelooperCreate` in the C API now has a Module parameter, and
  `RelooperRenderAndDispose` does not.
  - The JS API now has the `Relooper` constructor receive the `Module`.
- Relooper: Condition properties on Branches must not have side effects.

older
-----

- `BinaryenSetFunctionTable` in the C API no longer accepts an array of
  functions, instead it accepts an array of function names, `const char**
  funcNames`. Previously, you could not include imported functions because they
  are of type `BinaryenImportRef` instead of `BinaryenFunctionRef`. #1650

- `BinaryenSetFunctionTable` in the C API now expects the initial and maximum
  table size as additional parameters, like `BinaryenSetMemory` does for pages,
  so tables can be grown dynamically. #1687

- Add `shared` parameters to `BinaryenAddMemoryImport` and `BinaryenSetMemory`,
  to support a shared memory. #1686
