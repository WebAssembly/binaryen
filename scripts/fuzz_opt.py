'''
Run various fuzzing operations on random inputs, using wasm-opt. See
"testcase_handlers" below for the list of fuzzing operations.

Usage:

./scripts/fuzz_opt.py

That will run forever or until it finds a problem.

You can put files in the local directory 'fuzz' (under the top level of the
binaryen repo) and the fuzzer will treat them as important content to fuzz
with high frequency.

Setup: Some tools are optional, like emcc and wasm2c. The v8 shell (d8),
however, is used in various sub-fuzzers and so it is mandatory.

Note: For afl-fuzz integration, you probably don't want this, and can use
something like

BINARYEN_CORES=1 BINARYEN_PASS_DEBUG=1 afl-fuzz -i afl-testcases/ -o afl-findings/ -m 100 -d -- bin/wasm-opt -ttf --fuzz-exec --Os @@

(that is on a fixed set of arguments to wasm-opt, though - this
script covers different options being passed)

# You may want to print out part of "o" or "e", if the output matters and not
# just the return code. For example,
#
#   cat o | tail -n 10
#
# would print out the last few lines of stdout, which might be useful if that
# mentions the specific error you want. Make sure that includes the right
# details (sometimes stderr matters too), and preferably no more (less details
# allow more reduction, but raise the risk of it reducing to something you don't
# quite want).
#
# To do a "dry run" of what the reducer will do, copy the original file to the
# test file that this script will run on,
#
#   cp %(original_wasm)s %(temp_wasm)s
#
# and then run
#
#   bash %(reduce_sh)s
#
# You may also need to add  --timeout 5  or such if the testcase is a slow one.
#
# If the testcase handler uses a second wasm file, you may be able to reduce it
# using BINARYEN_SECOND_WASM.

You found a bug! Please report it with

  seed: %(seed)d

and the exact version of Binaryen you found it on, plus the exact Python
version (hopefully deterministic random numbers will be identical).

You can run that testcase again with "fuzz_opt.py %(seed)d"

The initial wasm file used here is saved as %(original_wasm)s

You can reduce the testcase by running this now:

||||
vvvv


%(wasm_reduce)s %(features)s %(original_wasm)s '--command=bash %(reduce_sh)s' -t %(temp_wasm)s -w %(working_wasm)s


^^^^

Make sure to verify by eye that the output says something like this:

The following value should be 0:
  0
The following value should be 1:
  1

(If it does not, then one possible issue is that the fuzzer fails to write a
valid binary. If so, you can print the output of the fuzzer's first command
(using -ttf / --translate-to-fuzz) in text form and run the reduction from that,
passing --text to the reducer.)

You can also read "%(reduce_sh)s" which has been filled out for you and includes
docs and suggestions.

After reduction, the reduced file will be in %(working_wasm)s
