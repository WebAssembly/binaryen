ClusterFuzz run.py script: when run by ClusterFuzz, it uses wasm-opt to generate
a fixed number of testcases. This is a "blackbox fuzzer", see

https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz/setting-up-fuzzing/blackbox-fuzzing/

This file should be bundled up together with the other files it needs, see
bundle_clusterfuzz.py.
